- Your Screen Will Work Perfectly.




If the screen has a bunch of vertical lines scattered throughout the display,please do the following:
1. sudo vi /boot/config.txt
2. Find the line with "dpi_output_format".
3. Change the value FROM "0x07f003" to "0x07f213"
4. Save/close/reboot
This inverts the pixel clock, which does the trick. No more black lines!
